## üìù Overview

Jobit is a job search application designed for developers. It streamlines the job search process with recommendations, search functionality, and salary estimations based on location. Job listings are sourced from the [jsearch api](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch) and uses the google maps api to present you with the latest jobs in your area.
